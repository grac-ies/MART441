sorry this is late agh it was pretty hard. I really like what the outcome though! i wish all coding classes were in person, for me at least. coding 2 in person has helped me so so much. i guess i really like color because i made the title change color for my plug in lol. i found that through this process i was constantly asking chat gpt what certain lines of code meant bc all the new character are a little overwhelming. but the more i go over it the better i will get!
