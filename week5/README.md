i had chat gpt help me a little with small errors and understanding the math. im still having an issue where somethimes the images wont appear. next week ill for sure add a style sheet and maybe look for images that are all the same size, they are alll supposed to be genrally size 12 but some of them are vertical. this project took me some time because i want to make sure everythig is set up to add the next steps in!  (i fixed the image issue, one of them was a png lol)
