my page is more simple, I decided to take it easy since ive never worked with this before. Next week ill be a little more creative lol.
chatgpts rendition was almost fill in the blanks, it gave multi-line comments declaring sections it also added margins. I do feel as though 
I could explain the code fairly easily. it was pretty basic coding with one or two differnet things. I find it easier for me to understand if
I space everything out a bit more so chatgpts is more dense than mine.
