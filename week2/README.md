my page is more simple, I decided to take it easy since I've never worked with this before. Next week I'll be a little more creative lol. I had fun inspecting websites it was neat to see it all laid out for an actual website. 
chatgpts rendition was almost fill-in-the-blanks, it gave multi-line comments declaring sections and added margins. I do feel as though 
I could explain the code fairly easily. It was pretty basic coding with one or two different things. I find it easier for me to understand if
I space everything out a bit more so chatgpts is denser than mine.
